# Browser Primitives Example

This example renders Ruby-authored `Three::Line` and `Three::Points` objects from generic `BufferGeometry` attributes through the Three.js browser backend.

Install browser dependencies and serve the repository root over HTTP:

```sh
pnpm install
ruby -run -e httpd . -p 8000
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:8000/examples/browser/primitives/
```

The repository root must be served, not only this directory, because `boot.mjs` loads browser packages from `node_modules/` and `main.rb` loads the library source from `lib/`.

## Browser Smoke Test

Install the optional Node dependency and browser binary:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm exec playwright install chromium
```

Run the browser smoke test:

```sh
pnpm test:browser:primitives
```
